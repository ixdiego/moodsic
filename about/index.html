<p>Moodsicâ„¢ is not exactly a web application that generates the music video from your mood. In fact, it's not a real product at all.</p>

<p>This is just my <a href="http://makersquare.com">MakerSquare</a> final project.</p>

<p>Although this may looks like a (very) simple by today standards and may not be anything even the simplest free Wordpress theme would be, there is a considerable amount of work has gone into making it look and behave the way it does.</p>

<p>Most importanly: it was (almost) all coded by me with front-end developent knowledge I have accrued over my 10 weeks as a MakerSquare student</p>

<p>Moodsic features applied work in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. It also Foundation: a responsive web HTML and CSS framework and Jekyll: a static page/blog generator </p>
